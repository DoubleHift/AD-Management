# AD-Management
The project is an extra layered project. React is used on the front side of the web, Python Django is used on the back side, Microsoft Server is used to create AD, and C# is used to access AD data.

<b>I had to split the project into 2, if you download the rars and combine them it will work without any problems.<b/>
